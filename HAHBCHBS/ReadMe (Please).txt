- HOW AN HEXADIMENSIONAL BOY CLEANS HIS BIDIMENSIONAL SPACESHIP -

To whomever is playing this game, beware.
HAHBCHBS (yeah, that's the game's acronym) is deliberatly unfinished, yet it strives to be as 
polished as possible.*

Now it comes the difficult part, where I have to convince you that this game is more
than a stupid title and that it can convey new gameplay diversifiers for an after all static,
nevertheless fun, structure as the one of Arkanoid.
As you noticed (or will notice), the level canvas of my game is egg-shaped. This could be
a totally game-breaking feature for the original Arkanoid, as the normals of the borders tend to 
face downward. Therefore, it can be common for the player to struggle sending the ball in the
upper parts of levels like these. That's why Arkanoids' levels have always been so "rectangular".

Actually, a skilled player could manage to make the ball bounce on the bar in almost every 
direction he wants.

So... why can't we all be able to determine a trajectory?

That's exactly what "How an Hexadimensional Boy Cleans His Bidimensional Spaceship" does.

Being able to stop time allows every one of us to play Arkanoid as an extremely skilled player.
The game I made is not intended to be a game, but more of a proof that we can enjoy Arkanoid in other 
forms and shapes.

Cheers,

PS: 
I want to be clear that every feature (or lack of features) in this game is NOT intended as a form of disrespect of any kind.
After I re-coded all the elastic collision logics in Unity from scratches, I just needed to have fun and to be somehow provocative.
Hopefully, it'll make you laugh as well. (In that case, let me know)




* The player is hexadimensional, that's why he is not confined by the borders of the spaceship
