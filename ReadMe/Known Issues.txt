***KNOWN ISSUES***

IT's NOT A BUG:
	- The main character is an hexadimensional being. Therefore his ability to travel outside of his
	  spaceship was made on purpose. Moreover, this feature facilitates the player in directioning the ball bounce.
	  

IT'S A BUG:
	- Because of the OnTriggerEnter2D built-in function in Unity, the player may not recognize two colliders that
	  are close one another. Therefore, the ball may "evade" from the spaceship. 
	  At the current state of the build, there are rough escamotage to prevent the game to break, but they're not 100%
	  working.
	  The issue will not be completely fixed, as it will require to almost re-think the physics logics I implemented.

	- Every time the player returns to the main menu, a new AudioSource is created and it overlays with the previous
	  audiosource, which is marked as DontDestroyOnLoad(). 
	  [FIXED]
